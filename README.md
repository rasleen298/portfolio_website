# portfolio_website
This is my Portfolio website developed using Django framework. Will be deploying it soon!

The site allows blog authors to create text-only blogs using the Admin site, and any logged in user to add posts.
It has two models, one for Blog and other for projects.

The job model used for hosting project work at the site, contain imagefield and description of the projects. I will be hyper-linking it with the project pages soon!
Blog Model takes in image,title,description, date and time for publishing the blog as its parameters.
